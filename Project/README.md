Sentiment Analysis of Movie Reviews using RNN on Amazon Sagemaker

Here I build a simple web app that interacts with a recurrent neural network (RNN) deployed on Amazon Sagemaker. The RNN is trained on dataset of movie reviews to predict the review sentiment given a user review. The API of the deployed RNN is also publicly accessible and is used by the web app to send data and retrieve predictions.
